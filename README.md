# Credit-Card-Customer-Prediction
The objective is to analyze credit card customer data to understand their behavior and usage patterns. By identifying key factors that influence customer attrition, we aim to build a predictive model to classify customers at risk of leaving. This insight will help the bank create targeted strategies to improve customer retention and satisfaction.
